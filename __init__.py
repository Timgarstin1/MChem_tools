"""
Some Documentation about MChem_tools goes here. All modules should have this in the
__init__ folder at the top, in tripple double quotes - pep

MChem_tools is a bunch of scripts created by Tomas and hopefully maintained by the Evans
Group.

To access the help, from python or ipython, type help(MChem_tools) to get general help

To get more detailed help from a module for example, type help(MChem_tools.AC_tools)

If you find missing documentation in any of this, please request a git push to github.

Initial documentation written by Ben - expect spelling mistakes.
